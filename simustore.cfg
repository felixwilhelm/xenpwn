/*
 * Sample configuration file for Simutrace 3.1
 *
 * This is the server configuration file. It contains all options that the
 * server understands. Simutrace utilizes the libconfig library to read
 * structured configuration files. For more information on the grammar please
 * refer to the libconfig documentation.
 *
 * To use the configuration file start the server with the -c option (full name
 * "--server.configuration"), specifying the name of the file:
 *
 *  ./simustore -c simustore.cfg
 *
 * You may also set all options as command line parameters using their full
 * path, proceeded by "--", or their short name (if available), proceeded
 * by "-". For example to specify the logging level you may write:
 *
 *      ./simustore --server.loglevel 5
 *  or  ./simustore -v 5
 *
 * Supplying the same option in both, the configuration file and the command
 * line, will lead the server to ignore the setting in the configuration file
 * and apply the value given via the command line.
 *
 * Options in this configuration file are set according to their default
 * values and thus may be commented-out or removed without effect. Alternative
 * values which might be helpful are commented-out with "//".
 *
 * NOTE: All paths must comply with the operating system's syntax. This sample
 * defaults to the Linux format. Change the paths for Windows accordingly.
 *
 * Most important settings for...
 *  ...general setup: server.workspace, server.bindings,
 *  ...performance  : server.memmgmt.poolSize, server.memmgmt.readAhead,
 *                    client.memmgmt.poolSize

           Finding the right value for a system requires a bit of
           experimentation. A value of 0 deactivates read-ahead.

           it also requires a lot of memory. Ensure to configure the pool sizes
           appropriately high. */

           which size it supports. Specifying the setting here, will force the
           server to use this value and ignore the client's request. This can
           be helpful when choosing a different pool size without having to
           add a call to StSessionSetConfiguration() in the client ahead of
           store creation. */
